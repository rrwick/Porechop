Porechop is a tool for finding and removing adapters from [Oxford Nanopore](https://nanoporetech.com/) reads. Adapters on the ends of reads are trimmed off, and when a read has an adapter in its middle, it is treated as chimeric and chopped into separate reads. Porechop performs thorough alignments to effectively find adapters, even at low sequence identity.

Porechop also supports demultiplexing of Nanopore reads that were barcoded with the [Native Barcoding Kit](https://store.nanoporetech.com/native-barcoding-kit-1d.html).

I have written Porechop for, and tested it on, 1D Nanopore reads. Its performance is unknown on 2D or 1D<sup>2</sup> reads, so use with caution on those datasets!

# Requirements

* Linux or macOS
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) 2.7, 3.4 or later
* C++ compiler
    * If you're using [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/), version 4.9.1 or later is required (check with `g++ --version`).
    * Recent versions of [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org/) and [ICC](https://software.intel.com/en-us/c-compilers) should also work (C++14 support is required).

I haven't tried to make Porechop run on Windows, but it should be possible. If you have any success on this front, let me know and I'll add instructions to this README!



#  Installation

### Install from source

Running the `setup.py` script will compile the C++ components of Porechop and install a `porechop` executable:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop.git
cd Porechop
python3 setup.py install
porechop -h
```

Notes:
* If the last command complains about permissions, you may need to run it with `sudo`.
* Install just for your user: `python setup.py install --user`
    * If you get a strange "can't combine user with prefix" error, read [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4495120).
* Install to a specific location: `python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME/.local`
* Install with pip (local copy): `pip install path/to/Porechop`
* Install with pip (from GitHub): `pip install git+https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop.git`
* Porechop includes `ez_setup.py` for users who don't have [setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) installed, though that script is [deprecated](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/581). So if you run into any installation problems, make sure setuptools is installed on your computer: `pip install setuptools`


### Build and run without installation

By simply running `make` in Porechop's directory, you can compile the C++ components but not install an executable. The program can then be executed by directly calling the `porechop-runner.py` script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop.git
cd Porechop
make
./porechop-runner.py -h
```


# Quick usage examples

__Basic adapter trimming:__<br>
`porechop -i input_reads.fastq.gz -o output_reads.fastq.gz`

__Demultiplex barcoded reads:__<br>
`porechop -i input_reads.fastq.gz -b output_dir`

__Trimmed reads to stdout, if you prefer:__<br>
`porechop -i input_reads.fastq.gz > output_reads.fastq`

__Throw out reads with middle adapters (instead of splitting them):__<br>
`porechop -i input_reads.fastq.gz -o output_reads.fastq.gz --discard_middle`

__Also works with FASTA:__<br>
`porechop -i input_reads.fasta -o output_reads.fasta`

__More verbose output:__<br>
`porechop -i input_reads.fastq.gz -o output_reads.fastq.gz --verbosity 2`

__Got a big server?__<br>
`porechop -i input_reads.fastq.gz -o output_reads.fastq.gz --threads 100`



# How it works

### Find matching adapter sets
 
Porechop first aligns a subset of reads (default 10000 reads, change with `--check_reads`) to all known adapter sets. Adapter sets with at least one high identity match (default 90%, change with `--adapter_threshold`) are deemed present in the sample.

Identity in this step is measured over the full length of the adapter. E.g. in order to qualify for a 90% match, an adapter could be present at 90% identity over its full length, or it could be present at 100% identity over 90% of its length, but a 90% identity match over 90% of the adapter length would not be sufficient.

The [alignment scoring scheme](http://seqan.readthedocs.io/en/master/Tutorial/DataStructures/Alignment/ScoringSchemes.html) used in this and subsequent alignments can be modified using the `--scoring_scheme` option (default: match = 3, mismatch = -6, gap open = -5, gap extend = -2).


### Trim adapters from read ends

The first and last bases in each read (default 100 bases, change with `--end_size`) are aligned to each present adapter set. When a long enough (default 4, change with `--min_trim_size`) and strong enough (default 75%, change with `--end_threshold`) match is found, the read is trimmed. A few extra bases (default 2, change with `--extra_end_trim`) past the adapter match are removed as well to ensure it's all removed.

Identity in this step is measured over the _aligned part_ of the adapter, not its full length. E.g. if the last 5 bases of an adapter exactly match the first 5 bases of a read, that counts as a 100% identity match and those bases will be trimmed off. This allows Porechop to effectively trim partially present barcodes.

The default `--end_threshold` is low (75%) because false positives (trimming off some sequence that wasn't really an adapter) shouldn't be too much of a problem with long reads, as only a tiny fraction of the read is lost.


### Split reads with internal adapters

The entirety of each read is aligned to the present adapter sets to spot cases where an adapter is in the middle of the read, indicating a chimera. When a strong enough match is found (default 85%, change with `--middle_threshold`), the read is split. If the resulting parts are too short (default less than 1000 bp, change with `--min_split_read_size`), they are discarded.

The default `--middle_threshold` (85%) is higher than the default `--end_threshold` (75%) because false positives in this step (splitting a read that is not chimeric) could be more problematic than false positives in the end trimming step. If false negatives (failing to split a chimera) are worse for you than false positives (splitting a non-chimera), you should reduce this threshold (e.g. `--middle_threshold 70`).

Extra bases are also removed next to the hit, and how many depends on the side of the adapter. If we find an adapter that's expected at the start of a read, it's likely that what follows is good sequence but what precedes it may not be. Therefore, a few bases are trimmed after the adapter (default 10, change with `--extra_middle_trim_good_side`) and more bases are trimmed before the adapter (default 100, change with `--extra_middle_trim_bad_side`). If the found adapter is one we'd expect at the end of the read, then the "good side" is before the adapter and the "bad side" is after the adapter.

Here is a real example of the "good" and "bad" sides of an adapter. The adapter is in the middle of this snippet (SQK-NSK007_Y_Top at about 90% identity). The bases to the left are the "bad" side, and their repetitive nature is clear. The bases to the right are the "good" side and represent real biological sequence.

```


### Discard reads with internal adapters

If you run Porechop with `--discard_middle`, the reads with internal adapters will be thrown out instead of split.

This approach might make sense if you are trimming reads from a barcoded run, as chimeric reads may combine sequences from different bins. For example, consider this read:
```
NB01_rev - SEQUENCE_1 - SQK-NSK007_Y_Top - NB02_rev -  SEQUENCE_2
```
SEQUENCE_1 belongs in the NB01 bin and SEQUENCE_2 belongs in the NB02 bin, so while we could split the read, we would end up with contamination from another bin. Throwing the read out with `--discard_middle` might be the better option.


### Barcode demultiplexing

Porechop can also demultiplex the reads into bins based on which barcode was found. This is done by using the `-b` option, which specifies an output directory for the trimmed reads (each barcode in a separate file), instead of `-o`.

Reads are only assigned to a barcode bin if the match is strong enough (default 75%, change with `--barcode_threshold`) and sufficiently better than the second-best barcode match (default 5% better, change with `--barcode_diff`). E.g. with default settings, if barcode NB01 was found at 79% identity and NB02 was found at 76% identity, the read will not be assigned to a barcode bin because the results were too close. But if you used `--barcode_diff 1`, then that read _would_ be assigned to the NB01 bin.

Porechop looks for barcodes at the start and end of each read. If the best start-read match is different from the best end-read match, then the read will not be put in a barcode bin (this could be caused by a chimeric read). By default, Porechop will bin reads where only one barcode match is found (e.g. NB01 at the read start, nothing at the read end). If you use the `--require_two_barcodes` option, Porechop will be more stringent and only assign reads to a barcode bin which have a barcode match at their start _and_ end. Also, the `--discard_middle` option is always active when demultiplexing barcoded reads (because the pieces of chimeric reads may belong in separate bins).

Usage examples:
* __Default settings__:<br>
`porechop -i input_reads.fastq.gz -b output_dir`
* __Stringent binning__ (more reads in "none" bin but low risk of misclassified reads):<br>
`porechop -i input_reads.fastq.gz -b output_dir --barcode_threshold 85 --require_two_barcodes`
* __Lenient binning__ (fewer reads in "none" bin but higher risk of misclassification):<br>
`porechop -i input_reads.fastq.gz -b output_dir --barcode_threshold 60 --barcode_diff 1`


### Output

If Porechop is run with the output file specified using `-o`, it will display progress info to stdout. It will try to deduce the format of the output reads using the output filename (can handle `.fastq`, `.fastq.gz`, `.fasta` and `.fasta.gz`). The `--format` option can be used to override this automatic detection.

Alternately, you can run Porechop with `-b` which specifies a directory for barcode bins. Porechop will then make separate read files in this directory for each barcode sequence (see [Barcode demultiplexing](#barcode-demultiplexing) for more details on the process). The files will be named using the barcode name or "none" if no barcode call was made (e.g. `NB01.fastq.gz`, `NB02.fastq.gz`, `none.fastq.gz`). The reads will be outputted in either FASTA or FASTQ format, as determined by the input read format or the `--format` option, and are always gzipped.

If Porechop is run without `-o` or `-b`, then it will output the trimmed reads to stdout and print its progress info to stderr. The output format of the reads will be FASTA/FASTQ based on the input reads, or else can be specified using `--format`.

Whether or not `-o` or `-b` is used, the `--verbosity` option will change the output of progress info:
* `--verbosity 0` gives no progress output.
* `--verbosity 1` (the default) gives summary info about end adapter trimming and shows all instances of middle adapter splitting.
* `--verbosity 2` shows sequences and is described below.


### Verbose output

If you call Porechop with `--verbosity 2`, then it will display the start/end of each read show the trimming in colour. Red indicates the adapter sequence and yellow indicates additional trimmed bases:

<p align="center"><img src="misc/end_trimming.png" alt="End trimming"></p>


If you are [demultiplexing barcodes](#barcode-demultiplexing), then this output will also show the barcodes found at the start/end of each read, along with the final call for the read's bin:

<p align="center"><img src="misc/verbose_barcodes.png" alt="Barcodes"></p>


The same colour scheme is used for middle adapters, but only reads with a positive hit are displayed:
